# corpus-phonetics
This folder contains copies of the executable notebooks associated with my AMP 2019 conference poster. Click on the files on the corpus-phonetics folder to show the notebook for the corresponding experiment. They have the .md extension e.g. "show_i_u_a_vowels.md". If using a small screen (e.g. smartphone) you may need to first click on "View code". Not all the notebooks view well on small screens but the figures showing the main results display ok and are usually at the end of the notebook.
