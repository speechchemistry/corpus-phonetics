# corpus-phonetics
This repository contains the executable notebooks associated with our 2019 Annual Meeting on Phonology paper: [Corpus phonetics for under-documented languages](http://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/amphonology/article/view/4682/4312) . Click on the files on the corpus-phonetics folder to show the notebook for the corresponding experiment. They have the .md extension e.g. "formant_plot_of_kera_vowels.md". If using a small screen (e.g. smartphone) you may need to first click on "View code". Not all the notebooks view well on small screens but the figures showing the main results display ok and are usually at the end of the notebook. The .md files are automatically derived from the .Rmd files using "knitr". I have tried to include a small sample of derived data files where possible - copyright issues don't allow us to include the full dataset. However the original data can be seen at https://live.bible.is/bible/KERABT/MRK/1 . We are grateful to Faith Comes By Hearing for providing us with the original WAV files recorded before music was added.
