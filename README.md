# corpus-phonetics
This folder contains copies of the executable notebooks associated with my AMP 2019 conference poster. Click on the files on the corpus-phonetics folder to show the notebook for the corresponding experiment. They have the .md extension e.g. "show_i_u_a_vowels.md". If using a small screen (e.g. smartphone) you may need to first click on "View code". Not all the notebooks view well on small screens but the figures showing the main results display ok and are usually at the end of the notebook.

More information on Kera vowel height harmony (from Pearce, 2012)
Any high vowel causes all vowels to be high
Kera has height dominance, so high vowels in the root will trigger left to right harmony and 
high vowel suffixes will trigger right to left harmony. The domain for this harmony is the 
morphological word. 
mirk-a > (mír)(kɨ́:) ‘greet her (3sf)’ (Left-to-right) 
ba:d-u > (bɨ:)(dù:) ‘wash him (3sm)’ (Right-to-left)
