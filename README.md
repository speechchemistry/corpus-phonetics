# corpus-phonetics
This folder contains copies of the executable notebooks associated with my AMP 2019 conference poster. Click on the files on the corpus-phonetics folder to show the notebook for the corresponding experiment. Or if using a small screen (e.g. smartphone) then click on "View code". Not all the notebooks view well on small screens but figures are usually at the end of the notebook.
